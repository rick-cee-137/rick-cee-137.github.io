# About Me

I am Tariq, a bad python programmer exploring different topics.
This Blog is an extension of my private repos containing resources and a front for me to show my messed up brain.

Feel free to fork the website and make a better version or contribute to topics i explore through [email](mailto:tariqmohamed59@gmail.com)
