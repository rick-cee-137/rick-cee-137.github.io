# **Welcome!**

I am a Computer Science and Electronics enthusiast.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

My main interests are in Machine Learning and Data Science.
I work on building Machine learning systems as a profession and work on building routines and optimising and learning structures and patterns. This Blog is a Tracker for my progress on concepts and ideas existing in the tiny filament of my brain.

You can read more about me in the [About page](/_pages/about.md).
