# . . .


- the first time i encountered the word was during 12th grade.
- everyone was busy with calculus while i was still struggling with what a trivial solution to a equation meant. the answer to the question is actually trivial! (word play huh!).
- so next on fast forward to college, calculus was a set of formulas you use to solve equations that had squiggly things in front of them. during this period was when i first encountered Stewart the ground truth book for calculus. i tried understanding the basics. so according to my understanding:
	- u break down a function and approximate it when u differentiate a function. i
	- integration is building the same function using fundamental units.
	- i know this is a wrong understanding, because it felt awfully similar to power series expansion.
- then came my final year of mathematics, thats when i first encountered differential equations and partial diff in real world, like the head equation and so on. my understanding during that period:
	- purely understand differentials in terms of rate of change which was inspired from 3b1b videos. so everywhere i looked i saw rate of changes, its like that given a hammer everything looks like a nail scenario.
	- but i really enjoyed solving them, actually that was the only math course i helped other people to understand, because it felt so intuitive and beautiful to understand equations like heat equation in terms of rate of changes and boundary conditions.
- fast forward again, and boom we land during my start of my ML journey. everywhere i looked i saw people recommending math to start Ml. i even found resources that confirmed with my feeling that i can learn ML without math.
- i set off on my journey but as i kept going deep inside i only encountered differentiation more than ever. my understanding during that period:
	- one of the few algorithms that i fell in love with is SGD(stochastic gradient descent) god its a beautiful piece of math. i have manually implemented this algorithm so many times.
	- but as time passed i kept building on this flawed attempt.
	- i can actually understand complex math, but it wont be correct because it is always stemmed form flawed attempt.
- the trauma continues ...
